By using a Custom Event and creating an event hub, components never talk directly to each other, meaning to each other they don't exist. They communicate directly through the event hub. Since the only thing they have in common is the event hub, changes can be made to each one without breaking the code. Each component only listens to what it wants to listen to.",
